        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Neuroscience</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Ammar Syed, student at the University of California, Riverside, is an Honors student and a recipient of Dougherty Valley High’s Principal Excellence award. From 2008 until now, he was an avid participant in the Boy Scouts of America, learning skills necessary for leadership and self-improvement. He worked hard during his duration with his Troop to earn the highest rank of honor, Eagle Scout. Meanwhile, he was also a fierce competitor for his school’s DECA team. He placed in State Level Competitions multiple times, and was a national finalist for his event in business analytics. 
        <br><br>

To begin 2019, he started as a cashier at the Kebab Shop. There he needed to apply communication skills and marketing skills to market products to his customers. During his time there, he moved up the ranks and became the lead for the front of the house. His early career skills also are developed as his time as a tutor for students ranging from kindergarten to 12th grade.
<br><br>

Syed also loves travel, sports, and photography. He is known for the portraits he captures with his camera, highlighting golden moments with friends and family. He is a huge sports enthusiast, and a die-hard Los Angeles Lakers fan. Syed loves to travel, and has been across the world to places like Dubai, Singapore, England, and much of the United States. With help from social media and friends, he hopes to show his vision of people together enjoying time, and hopes he becomes an inspiration to others.
<br><br>

Since a young age, Syed has dreamed of becoming a surgeon. His mother, a Family Physician, played a large role in his love for medicine. He saw how she changed so many lives, and he wanted to give others opportunities they may not have had. His love for medicine is apparent in his papers on recent diseases, including the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). He was able to further his experience in the medical field with an internship at his local orthodontist clinic. There he observed patient interaction, medical judgment being put to use, and the skills of a business administrator running the clinic. He also learned sanitizing techniques that medical or dental facilities use when they need to sterilize their equipment.
<br><br>

During his time as a student at the University of California, Riverside, he has maintained a GPA of 3.71 and a STEM GPA of 4.00. He has been selected to be a part of University Honors, and has been selected in the prestigious honor society Gamma Beta Phi. He is an active member of the Muslim Student Association, helping to run logistics. On top of all that, Syed is a COPE Health Scholar, serving the Riverside community by volunteering his time at the Riverside Community Hospital. There he works with psychiatric patients, orthopedic trauma, and much more.
<br><br>

At the age of 18, Syed has established himself in his academics and hopes to further his education. His next goal is to enter into medical school at his dream college, University of California, San Francisco. He is happiest with his three younger brothers and his parents in his hometown of San Ramon, CA.
